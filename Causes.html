                    <ol>
                            <li>Cooking equipment</li>
                            <P>Pots and pans can overheat and cause a fire very easily if the person cooking gets distracted and leaves cooking unattended. Always stay in the room, or ask someone to watch your food, when cooking on hotplates.</P>

                            <li>Heating</li>
                            <p>Keep portable heaters at least one metre away from anything that could easily catch fire such as furniture, curtains, laundry, clothes and even yourself. If you have a furnace, get it inspected once a year to make sure it is working to safety standards.</p>

                            <li>Smoking in bedrooms</li>
                            <p> A cigarette that is not put out properly can cause a flame, as the butt may stay alit for a few hours. It could burst into flames if it came into contact with flammable materials, such as furniture.</p>

                            <li> Electrical equipment</li>
                            <p>A power point that is overloaded with double adapter plugs can cause a fire from an overuse of electricity. A power point extension cord can also be a fire hazard if not used appropriately. Double check the appliances and power points in your home.</p>

                            <li> Candles</li>
                            <p>Candles look and smell pretty, but if left unattended they can cause a room to easily burst into flames. Keep candles away from any obviously flammable items such as books and tissue boxes. Always blow a candle out before leaving a room.</p>

                            <li>Curious children</li>
                            <p>Kids can cause a fire out of curiosity, to see what would happen if they set fire to an object. Keep any matches or lighters out of reach of children, to avoid any curiosity turned disaster. Install a smoke alarm in your child’s room and practice a home escape plan with your children and family in case there was a fire.</p>

                            <li>Faulty wiring</li>
                            <p>Homes with inadequate wiring can cause fires from electrical hazards. Some signs to see if you’ve bad wiring are:
                                Lights dim if you use another appliance;
                                For an appliance to work, you have to disconnect another;
                                Fuses blow or trip the circuit frequently.
                            </p>

                            <li> Flammable liquids</li>
                            <p>If you have any flammable liquids in the home or garage such as petrol, kerosene or methylated spirits, keep them away from heat sources and check the label before storing. Be careful when pouring these liquids.</p>
