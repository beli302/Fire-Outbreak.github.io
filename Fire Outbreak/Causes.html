                            <P>Pots and pans can overheat and cause a fire very easily if the person cooking gets distracted and
                                leaves cooking unattended. Always stay in the room, or ask someone to watch your food, when
                                cooking on hotplates.</P>
                            <li>Heating</li>

                            <p>Keep portable heaters at least one metre away from anything that could easily catch fire such as
                                furniture, curtains, laundry, clothes and even yourself. If you have a furnace, get it inspected
                                once a year to make sure it is working to safety standards.</p>
                            <li>Smoking in bedrooms</li>

                            <p> A cigarette that is not put out properly can cause a flame, as the butt may stay alit for a few
                                hours. It could burst into flames if it came into contact with flammable materials, such as
                                furniture.</p>
                            <li> Electrical equipment</li>

                            <p>A power point that is overloaded with double adapter plugs can cause a fire from an overuse of
                                electricity. A power point extension cord can also be a fire hazard if not used appropriately.
                                Double check the appliances and power points in your home.</p>
                                <li> Candles</li>

                            <p>Candles look and smell pretty, but if left unattended they can cause a room to easily burst into
                                flames. Keep candles away from any obviously flammable items such as books and tissue boxes.
                                Always blow a candle out before leaving a room.</p>
                            <li>Faulty wiring</li>

                            <p>Homes with inadequate wiring can cause fires from electrical hazards. Some signs to see if youâ€™ve
                                bad wiring are:
                                Lights dim if you use another appliance;
                                For an appliance to work, you have to disconnect another;
                                Fuses blow or trip the circuit frequently.
                            </p>
                            <li> Flammable liquids</li>

                            <p>If you have any flammable liquids in the home or garage such as petrol, kerosene or methylated
                                spirits, keep them away from heat sources and check the label before storing. Be careful when
                                pouring these liquids.</p>
